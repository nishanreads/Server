If you are testing a server that is not Internet-accessible, you can put host names in your hosts file in order to do local resolution.
For example, you might want to put a record in your hosts file to map a request for www.example.com to your local system,

127.0.0.1 www.example.com

A hosts file will probably be located at /etc/hosts or C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.
